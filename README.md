#### AnkiCli is ankidroid application clone for cli because i don't like anki interface and I don't want to use mouse for every move around here there so why not make it where I remain most of the time at terminal

---

** I making this cli to have Terminal UI it should be good looking hope so **

so Idea i that you make folder of topic in `$HOME/.ankiHome/` at anki home and make file inside that folder

then run the command with argument of that folder as input that you want to revise 

then code will read formated file and present you in Form of Terminal Ui

```txt
- // this show card start here
* this is front of card
* this is back of card
- // this format is show card end here
```

in this formated we should store the card in any file in that folder. Code will read all the file and show you randomly
